Hi! I am Sid. My area of research lies in Predictive Modelling, Statistical Machine Learning and Causal Inference. 
Previously, I have worked on its applications to areas such as Materials Informatics, Computational Social Sciences, Business Analytics and Enviromental Sciences.

In my free time you will find me listening to Classical Rock music, watching sitcoms or trying to find excuses to quote silly puns and Star Wars references. As a kid, I was quite fascinated by how Artificial Intelligence got potrayed in sci-fi movies and novels which ultimately got me doing research in this field today.

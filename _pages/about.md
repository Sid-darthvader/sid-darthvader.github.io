> **_“Do. Or do not. There is no try.”_** ~ Yoda, The Empire Strikes Back.

Hi! I am Sid. My area of research lies in Predictive Modelling, Statistical Machine Learning and more recently Causal Inference. 
Previously, I have worked in their applications in diverse areas such as Materials Informatics, Computational Social Sciences, Business Analytics and Environmental Sciences.
Uptill now, I have been quite fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://wwwfr.uni.lu/recherche/fstm/doe/members/stephane_bordas">Prof. Stéphane Bordas</a>, <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~MT/Abhishek_Tewari"> Prof. Abhishek Tewari</a> & <a href="https://math.snu.edu.in/people/faculty/niteesh-sahni">Prof. Niteesh Sahni</a> whose unparalleled support & guidance has helped me move forward in my career.

As a kid, I was quite fascinated by how Artificial Intelligence was potrayed in sci-fi movies and novels which ultimately led me into in this field today.
In my free time you will find me listening to classical rock music, binging on sitcoms, crime-thrillers or trying to find excuses to quote silly puns and Star Wars references.
